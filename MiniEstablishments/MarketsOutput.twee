<h1>The Markets of $town.name</h1>You wander through the streets of $town.name, and come across the market, which is located in $market.location. It seems that the vendors are organised by $market.organisation.

There's a $marketsellerA.racenote selling <<print either($market.selling)>> from a <<print either($market.tent)>>, a $marketsellerB.racenote selling <<print either($market.selling)>> from a <<print either($market.tent)>>, a $marketsellerC.racenote selling <<print either($market.selling)>>, and a $marketsellerD.racenote selling magical trinkets from a  <<print either($market.tent)>>. Or, at least, they're supposedly magical trinkets.

The $marketsellerD.manwoman beckons you over to $marketsellerD.hisher stall, and introduces $marketsellerD.himherself as <<link "$marketsellerD.name">><<set $currentNPC to $marketsellerD>><<goto "NPCProfile">><</link>>, a purveyor of fine goods. The $marketsellerD.racenote asks you for your ring size, and then $marketsellerD.heshe reaches below $marketsellerD.hisher table, and procures a ring...
