<<set $plotguy to setup.createNPC({ isShallow: true })>>You wander around the $tavern.wordNoun, and eventually find yourself in conversation with a $plotguy.height, $plotguy.weight $plotguy.gender who introduces $plotguy.himherself as $plotguy.firstName $plotguy.lastName. You can't help but notice $plotguy.firstName has a $plotguy.physicalTrait. You explain that you are adventurers, looking for work or otherwise profitable endeavours, and $plotguy.hisher $plotguy.eyes eyes light up, and $plotguy.firstName draws you closer, and whispers in a hushed tone 'I may have something of interest for you, in that case; <<print $plothook.people.random()>>'
