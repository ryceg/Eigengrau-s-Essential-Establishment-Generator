However, to a worthy lector, the script changes entirely and, in draconic, a tale is woven of the truw downfall. The humanoid races were powerless to the dragons, but the chromatics grew vain and the metallics could no longer tolerate their greed. Thus, the metallics aided the humanoids to stage an uprising and the chromatics were banished to the Inner Planes. But, the humanoids grew greedy and tricked the metallics banishing them with their kindred. The tale ends on an ominous note of plans for the dragons' imminent return."

The stories include: a tale of Gor'tak the Plunderer, who conquered an elven city and was brought down when he stole a cursed axe; the tale of Gor'tak's son Mur'nal, who tried to break the axe and two and ended up with two cursed axes; two stories about the half-orc twins Robald and Eron and their contests of strength (like when Eron tried to lift a mountain, but his feet didn't find any grip and he sunk away in the mud); and finally, three stories of the voyages of Zyarr the drunken priest and the times he ended up in a roc's nest, a frozen cave stocked with booze (all frozen solid), and Asmodeus' bathtub."

These he assembled in the form of the instrument he dubbed the Octarion, which, when played by his expert thumping produced a temporary Portal to other worlds. The book details his wanderings and adventures in these other worlds and sadly ends with his fatal wounding at an unfortunate tea-party turned duel in the Feylands. The epilogue reveals that the tales are penned by his companion, the priest Lucedol of Tuftsburg who met the bard on his first adventure (in this book) in fact freeing him from the clutches of the dreaded Lugomorphs of Artuick-Fell. The two became inseparable friends who ever after had the other's back... until that day."

Parts of the books have been described as downright obvious attempts at convincing the reader that formally inviting strangers into ones' home is common courtes and that sunlight is highly overrated. It conveniently fails to mention the vampiric weakness to running water, while simultaniously trying to spread awareness about potamophobia (the fear of rivers or running water)."
