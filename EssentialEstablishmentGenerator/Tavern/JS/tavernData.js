Having not yet developed a callous thick enough to endure the thorns, prickles and stings, many young Gnomes often wear carved wooden shoes and heavy leather gaiters to protect themselves. When a young Gnome reaches maturity, however, they are expected to retire their shoes back to the cobbler, where the toes are stuffed full of harvested berries, leaves, mushrooms and whatever else comes to hand. The shoes are then hung from the rafters over a large vat, where steam, time, and the natural yeasts in the porous wood allow droplets of alcoholic liquid to seep through the shoe, and fall into the roiling mixture below. Mixed with rainwater, and served in usually cleaned wooden shoes, the resulting beverage is incredibly potent, with a flavor profile that ranges from incredibly profane to lavender, with notes of sweet sap. Gnomes who consume it often do so in celebratory contexts, and in small quantities. Most others experience temporary blindness and an intense hatred for Gnomes.",
