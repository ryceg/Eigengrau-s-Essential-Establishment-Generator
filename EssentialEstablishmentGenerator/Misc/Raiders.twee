    "We have never challenged these fiends. We are powerless to stop them.",
    "A small group of adventurers came through and heard our plight. They sought to help, but the raiders cut them down. We were severely punished.",
    "One family couldn't pay their dues to the raiders. Not two days passed before those bastards made good on their threats.",
    "Some of the men in our village sought to drive out our tormentors. They failed, and the raiders made good on their threats.",
    "We routinely miss payments, and the raiders have yet to carry out their ultimate threat. However, they have punished us in less severe ways.",
    "We managed to drive the raiders off, but fear that they will soon return in greater numbers to make us pay for our defiance.",
    "We haven't dared to challenge them yet, but suspect that they wouldn't actually follow through on their threats. They seem to be more bark than bite.",
    "We've always complied with their demands, but they recently began warring with another raider encampment nearby. Now, they ask us for more and more! If it doesn't stop, we'll have nothing left to give.",
    "Recently, they have stopped coming to collect their payments. We do not know why, and fear to press our luck by investigating.",
    "A second group of raiders has recently arrived, and they, too, demand tribute! We can't possibly pay both.",
    "A stranger passed through town recently, and ended up killing several raiders in a tavern fight. He has already left, and we now fear retaliation.",
    "The raiders have a new leader, now, and this one is even more demanding and cruel than the last. We can't take this anymore!",
    "In spite of their abuses, they seem to spend more time backstabbing each other than enforcing their threats upon us. I can only imagine what it would be like without their in-fighting dividing them.",
    "These raiders are ruthless. Even though we've never defied them, they parade the mutilated remains of travellers through town just to remind us what they're capable of.",
    "There are many among their group who are actually decent folk. They try to keep the abuses from their comrades to a minimum, but can only do so much. If we could bring those few to our defense, it could make all the difference.",
    "So long as we pay on time, the abuses are kept to a minimum. We should really just be thankful that they aren't asking for more.",
    "There is no end to this hell in sight, and our spirits are broken. We keep nothing for ourselves, and are little better than slaves under the brutal rule of these raiders.",
    "We've had enough, and are preparing an ambush.",
    "It's hard to make our payments, but that's just how things work out here. We'd rather not risk inciting the raiders to anger.",
    "Just when we thought things couldn't get worse, one of our daughters was found murdered and brutalized. Enough is enough!"
