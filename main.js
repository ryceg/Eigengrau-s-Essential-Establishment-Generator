    I couldn't decide on which syntax mode was best, especially for dice.
    So I wound up including a bunch of options, and they all work essentially the same way.
    Though the dice 'parser' [e.g. dice('string')] syntax and the shortcuts [e.g. x.fm(), x.d()]
    perform slightly worse / are slightly slower than the other potential syntax modes.
    Supported syntax:
      1. the dice roller: (all the following work and are all equivalent to '3d6+10')
        a. dice(3, 6) + 10
        b. dice('3d6 + 10')
        c. dice('3d6+10')
        d. dice('3d6') + 10
        e. !!! dice('3d6' + 10) -- Will roll 3 610-sided dice; the parser can't accept mixed arguments
      2. the fairmath system (based on the ChoiceScript stats system)
        a. fm(50, 40)      [=70]
      3. Notes.
        a. be careful! rolling dice with floating point numbers or negatives will cause errors
        b. likewise, fairmath will spit out errors if it's given bizarre numbers

    Options:
      fmRange   : move the minimum and maximum range for the fairmath system, if you need to
            note that the results are constrained by this range, but can never actually hit it
            that is, [0, 100] will limit the actual numbers to 1-99,
            [10, 45] would limit the results to 11-44, etc.

   * `rolls` (the one that is providing the descriptions).
   *
   * It needs the propName to be exact, unless the optional `keyName` is specified.
   * This is for when you might want to tie several properties to the same attribute,

   * The `index` is an optional argument, which tells the function to look at
   * a different location in the array for the string. This is most useful for
   * when you have multiple descriptions tied to the same thing
   * (long and short descriptions, or cleanliness controlling bedCleanliness as well.)

        description: `Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring—this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.

      The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).`,
