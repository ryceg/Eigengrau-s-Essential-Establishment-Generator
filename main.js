'Does this belong to you?'","a small girl is crying in the road. She looks lost. If asked, her father told her to wait here for him while he went into the pub 'for a minute'.

retreat with every fall and spring\u2014this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It\u2019s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven\u2019t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it\u2019s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.

      The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).`,followers:{description:"",favouredWeapon:"",holyDays:{title:"Holy Days",children:[]}},gods:[{objectType:"deity",passageName:"DeityProfile",name:"Odin",key:"Odin",status:"alive",titles:["The Allfather","Lord of the Aesir","Flaming Eye","Battle Enhancer","Ancient One","Enemy of the Wolf","God of Burdens","Wise One","Spear god","Swift in Deciet","Wand Bearer","Teacher of Gods","Vistor of the Hanged","Father of Hosts","Raven God","The Hanging One","God of Victory"],aliases:[],rank:"leader",description:"",appearance:"",history:{title:"history",children:[]},powers:{title:"powers",children:[]},portfolios:["wisdom","death","royalty","the gallows","war","battle","victory","sorcery","poetry","frenzy","runic alphabet"],gender:"man",shape:"human",race:"god",faction:"aesir",domains:["knowledge","trickery","war","arcana"],channelDivinity:{title:"Channel Divinity",children:[]},alignment:"Lawful Good",symbol:"",combat:{title:"combat",children:[]},possessions:{children:[{title:"Gungir",description:"The spear Gungir is so well balanced it can hit any target, regardless of skill"},{title:"Draupnir",description:"A gold ring which drips forth eight identical rings after nine days"}]},realm:"Valhalla",followers:{description:void 0,favouredWeapon:"",holyDays:{title:"Holy Days",children:[{title:"earth",children:["Wednesday"]}]}},personality:{just:70,merciful:-85,chaste:-20},associations:{avatars:[],animals:["raven","wolf"],plants:["poppy"],monsters:[],gems:[],colours:[],miscellaneous:[]},beliefs:{title:"beliefs",children:[]},heresies:{title:"heresies",children:[]},blessings:{title:"blessings",children:[]},curses:{title:"curses",children:[]},allies:{title:"allies",children:[]},enemies:{title:"enemies",children:[]},relationships:[],maxims:[{title:""}]},{objectType:"deity",passageName:"DeityProfile",name:"Thor",key:"Thor",status:"alive",titles:["The one who Rides Alone","The one who Rules Alone","Protector of the Shrine","The Loud Weather God","The terrible","The Thunderer","Odinson","Strong-Spirit"],aliases:[],rank:"greater deity",description:"Thor is the God of Lightning, Thunder and Storms.
