<<if $smithy.expertiseroll gt 80>>
		On the bench lies a <<print either($smithy.weapons)>>, and just by looking at it, you can tell that the blacksmith is extremely talented at $blacksmith.hisher craft; this is a weapon clearly fit for a king.

<<elseif $smithy.expertiseroll gt 50>>

<<elseif $smithy.expertiseroll gt 40>>

<<elseif $smithy.expertiseroll gt 20>>
