### A Tabletop Generator Unlike Any Other :game_die:

[Eigengrau's Essential Establishment Generator](https://eigengrausgenerator.com/), or EEEG for short, is a tabletop procedural generation tool for towns, npcs, and more. It creates paragraphs of text suitable to be read directly to the players during a game. No longer do you have to simply describe a generic, unnamed tavern as "small"- this is the sort of stuff that you can read out instead:

**What It's For**

* Generate thousands of unique towns for table play
* Create new plothooks for games
* Generate new NPCs to flesh out existing places
* Help new and veteran DMs come up with fresh ideas for their table

## Live Build :rocket:
Go to https://eigengrausgenerator.com/ to see the most current live build of EEEG in action!

NOTE: The live build is often several weeks or months behind the current build here on GitHub. Compile the generator locally to see all the latest features and updates!

We love getting pull requests! You can find out more about contributing to the project [here.](https://github.com/ryceg/Eigengrau-s-Essential-Establishment-Generator/wiki/Contributing) 

You will need a recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org),
as well as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), which you can install by running `npm install -g yarn` once you have NodeJS installed.

Once you've cloned the project, run `yarn install` to install the required dependencies.

You will also need to download Tweego.
You can do so so either by running `yarn install-compiler`,
or by downloading it from [here.](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) and placing the contents inside _/Eigengrau-s-Essential-Establishment-Generator/.twine_.
if the _.twine_ folder does not already exist, just create one.

* Use `yarn test` to run tests.
* Use `yarn build` to build the output files. (Note that this will return a File Not Found error, but it is working) The entire thing will output to the /gh-pages folder as the index.html file.
* Use `yarn start` to start a development build that automatically rebuilds on file changes (Note that this will complain about circular dependency issues, but will work just fine).

If you don't want to code, that's okay! The Generator is built out of a novel's worth of words, and we're always in need of more descriptions. You can find writing tasks [here.](https://github.com/ryceg/Eigengrau-s-Essential-Establishment-Generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AWriting)

You can also find easy work to do on the generator [here.](https://github.com/ryceg/Eigengrau-s-Essential-Establishment-Generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

## Built With :hammer:

* [Twine](https://twinery.org/) - The front end framework 
* [Sugarcube 2](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/) - A language for Twine
* [TweeGo](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) - Twine command line compiler
