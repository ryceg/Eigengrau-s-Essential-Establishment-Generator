(“When the world is watching, one must prove that an attack upon oneself or one’s nation is folly.”) It is typically used to defend the use of downright vile acts during times of war by invoking a sense of patriotism and community.

To the unworthy, it consists of a rather somber description of a period of time in which the dragon's ruled the Forgotten Realms and their inevitable downfall where the dragons were taken down by an army of the combined forces of the world's humanoid races. However, to a worthy lector, the script changes entirely and, in draconic, a tale is woven of the truw downfall. The humanoid races were powerless to the dragons, but the chromatics grew vain and the metallics could no longer tolerate their greed. Thus, the metallics aided the humanoids to stage an uprising and the chromatics were banished to the Inner Planes. But, the humanoids grew greedy and tricked the metallics banishing them with their kindred. The tale ends on an ominous note of plans for the dragons' imminent return."

It was originally intended as a primer for would-be plane shifters and astral travellers, but the manuscript was partially destroyed in a fire and now the contents are damaged. The current owner has gone mildly insane trying to piece the manuscript back together, and has scrawled almost two year's worth of ramblings and half-thoughts in the margins of the text. While the work no longer primes the reader for the act of travelling to the Feywild, the combination of reading materials contained within the folio binding now prep the reader's mind for the bewildering and maddening magics encountered there (giving advantage against the enchantment and illusion effects created by denizens of the Feywild)"

It is the magnum opus of a brilliant wizard known for her astute observations and nigh unhealthy obsession with dragons, who sadly perished during a wyvern attack while searching for a dragon graveyard in an isolated mountain chain; had she not perished she would likely have continued revising her work, as she had done for many decades beforehand. Some rarer versions have even been known to feature moving pictures, especially those of dragons in flight and their breath. While it contains a staggering amount of information, it is also very academically challenging and quite rare; as a result it is rarely found outside of restricted library sections, wizards' libraries, and the hoards of academically inclined dragons, especially blue and silver ones."

      summary: "A series of romantic novels featuring romance between vampires and humans which tries to cast vampires as villified people who just want to live in peace, while simultaneously overlooking their intense thirst for blood and blithe disregard for the lives of others. Parts of the books have been described as downright obvious attempts at convincing the reader that formally inviting strangers into ones' home is common courtes and that sunlight is highly overrated. It conveniently fails to mention the vampiric weakness to running water, while simultaniously trying to spread awareness about potamophobia (the fear of rivers or running water)."

The story ends with the paladin murdering the necromancer, as the necromancer had spent his magical powers healing some innocent villagers who were hurt in a goblin raid. It has been theorised that the story might have been written and distrubuted by an ancient vampire wizard as part of his smear campaign against so called "good" organised religions and militant orders, but this has never been conclusively proven.'
