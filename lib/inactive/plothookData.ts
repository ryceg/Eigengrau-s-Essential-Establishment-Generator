I've been charged to deliver this letter to the Duke, but I fear that I'm being followed and may meet my fate soon; the exact details are better left unknown, lest you make yourself a permanent target for holding the knowledge that I do. You must get this message to him. But do not open it, as the Duke will not touch it if the wax seal has been broken.",
