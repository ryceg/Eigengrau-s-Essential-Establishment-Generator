<<set _town to $town || $tempTown>>
Eigengrau's Generator procedurally generates towns that are ready out-of-the-box to read to players, complete with sociopolitics, descriptions, and those little touches of creativity that separate a hand-crafted tavern from the drudgery of improvising your umpteenth tavern on the spot.

This generator is different because it generates text that you can read out to players. Instead of "Dirty tavern, with a half orc bartender", you get whole paragraphs of text to immerse your players in the world that you've created.\

It creates towns from the ground up, with the biome impacting types of building material that are available, a town's wealth and population changing what establishments are featured, and sociopolitics and economic modeling influencing the types of people that inhabit the town.\

Eigengrau's Generator is built much like a website, with hyperlinks taking you to different pages. It also has <span class="tip dotted" title="Like this!">tooltips</span>, which provide quick additional information.\

If you get lost, you can always naviage via the breadcrumb menu in the top left, which currently reads "The _town.type of _town.name". That link will take you to the homepage.\
