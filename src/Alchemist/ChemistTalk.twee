$associatedNPC.firstName looks <<print setup.npcData.currentMood.random()>>, and idly shifts a box of <<print lib.alchemistData.ingredients.random()>> as $associatedNPC.heshe talks. The $associatedNPC.raceNote <<print $associatedNPC.chitchat.random()>> as you peruse the shop. $associatedNPC.firstName tells you that $associatedNPC.heshe is working on <<print lib.articles.output($building.brew.potionPurpose)>>, and points to the <<linkappend $building.brew.containerDescription t8n>>. Looking inside the $building.brew.vesselType, you see <<print lib.articles.output($building.brew.liquidDescription)>> bubbling away<</linkappend>>.
