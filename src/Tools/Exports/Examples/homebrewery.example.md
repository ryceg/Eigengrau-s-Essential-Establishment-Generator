Welfare is above average, considering the modest quality of life. Citizens can expect a decent education, provided they can pay for it. Healthcare is overtaxed and underfunded, though.</article> <article><h4>Law and Order</h4>The policing presence in Bugshaw is more of a militia; some of the members of <a data-id="a30067a9-e4b7-44a7-bf1e-aa74c832fe11" data-object-type="faction" class="link-internal a30067a9-e4b7-44a7-bf1e-aa74c832fe11" title="A quite small guards watch called The Truncheon of Bugshaw" href="#a30067a9-e4b7-44a7-bf1e-aa74c832fe11">The Truncheon of Bugshaw</a> are part time, and there is little need for the use of force outside of intruders. Law in Bugshaw is very much punitive based, and those that breach the laws can expect hard labor, incarceration, or sometimes public execution. Crime is an ugly stain on humanity, to be punished.

<h2>The Markets</h2>
<span id="8d8166e3-d5fa-448e-b30a-107dca99ee86"></span><p>You wander through the streets of Bugshaw, and come across the market, which is located in a series of small buildings connected by covered awnings. It seems that the vendors are organised by nothing; the place is a big disorganized mess. The market is known for the entertainers and musicians set up around the bazaar, and is riddled with the refuse of merchant horses and other livestock. Today the market is fairly packed, and people are bustling about and jostling each other to get to certain merchants.</p> <section><h3>Merchants</h3>  <p>A  <a data-id="28d514fc-8a4c-46f6-a3f0-927bf25d0150" data-object-type="npc" class="link-internal 28d514fc-8a4c-46f6-a3f0-927bf25d0150" title="A prime adult aged woman with a sharp chin called Pynelope Pitt who is a merchant." href="#28d514fc-8a4c-46f6-a3f0-927bf25d0150">prime adult aged human with a sharp chin</a> is beckoning "Dire ferret skins!

<h2>Marked Liquid</h2>
<span class="flex-line"></span> <span id="b3f8adaa-4019-491e-8219-dcdc1e86c745"></span><p>You enter Marked Liquid, a shabby hewn rock apothecary with a white tiled roof. Looking around, Marked Liquid must have had an explosion the day before; there is no other possible reason that a shop that deals with magical, often volatile chemicals would be so cluttered, crowded, and blatantly a danger to itself and the half-mile radius surrounding it. There are pots and pans of mixtures that have already spilt over crowding the desk, with potions that are currently brewing strewn around the floor. There's little hope to walk through the shop without putting your boot in something that you probably would prefer not to put it in. Just as you try and hesitate, you hear the distinct sound of 'no, please don't go!' come from the floorboards, which at first seemed to be sticky, but on closer inspection, was more... 'grabby'. There is a chemist behind the shop counter currently pouring ingredients into a tube.</p> <section><h3>Chemist</h3><p>a very tall man with very rounded ears welcomes you warmly while you look around.

Antonyr tells you that he is working on a component for a summoning ritual, and points to the <span class="macro-linkappend">quite large glass pot</span><span class="macro-linkappend-insert macro-linkappend-in">.

This church is protected by sellswords.</p> <p>You enter the large, rather messy church and notice a kneeler beneath a small statue or icon. The main room is octagonal in shape and is decorated with mostly wealthy looking holy art. The interior walls of the church are actually the hollowed husk of an enormous tree and the the ceiling is connected to the floor by columns. The church was designed by a renowned theologian of the clergy and it is arranged in a concentric fashion; the inner areas are inaccessible to most visitors.</p> <p>Within this holy place they pray to one god, but not the one the temple was originally dedicated to. The temple itself was originally dedicated to friendship and community and is known for dancing monks.</p> <h3>Priest</h3> <p>A temple priest is currently placing some nice smelling incense in a dirty looking incense holder.

You might not believe it, but there was a pretty nasty zombie outbreak which I had to defend my town against. I acquitted myself well in battle, and was awarded a medal for bravery. I'll always remember the time I met the love of my life, who is no longer with me. I went on a journey to find an ever-burning flame on the back of a giant turtle. I really did make it there, but I don't like to brag about it.One time I learned under the tutelage of <a data-id="a869a677-570a-4a79-a6bc-2892b40a80b2" data-object-type="npc" class="link-internal a869a677-570a-4a79-a6bc-2892b40a80b2" title="A quite squat female dwarf called Barbena Silverstone who is a painter." href="#a869a677-570a-4a79-a6bc-2892b40a80b2">Barbena Silverstone</a> a fallen painter. During that time I learned a lot about myself. I'll always remember the time I got to attend the royal feast of a local <a data-id="e90950b8-905b-4f21-94c8-32785a14fec9" data-object-type="npc" class="link-internal e90950b8-905b-4f21-94c8-32785a14fec9" title="A dwarf with a long, luxurious beard called Thoradin Glanhig who is a peasant." href="#e90950b8-905b-4f21-94c8-32785a14fec9">noble</a> in celebration of a bountiful summer harvest. I forget exactly when, but at one point, I shook the hand of a passing <a data-id="6f842ac4-ba7c-46d6-8720-063877d71dd6" data-object-type="npc" class="link-internal 6f842ac4-ba7c-46d6-8720-063877d71dd6" title="A dwarf with a dreadful beard called Fargrim Orcfoe who is a peasant." href="#6f842ac4-ba7c-46d6-8720-063877d71dd6">noble</a>. If I recall their handshake was nothing special. You might not believe it, but I was caught and convicted of theft, and spent 3 years doing hard labour before managing to escape. How could I ever forget the time I found my lost family heirloom, it is a Etherbound Chime of Shifting.<blockquote><h4>Etherbound Chime of Shifting</h4>The bearer can see creatures in the Border Ethereal that overlap with their plane as clearly as if they were fully in the bearer's plane. Such creatures appear as apparitions or ghosts. The bearer may change minor aspects of the physical appearance of this item.</blockquote> I apprenticed under <a data-id="36214210-5179-43d3-91d0-5a73b407e1b9" data-object-type="npc" class="link-internal 36214210-5179-43d3-91d0-5a73b407e1b9" title="An earlyish thirties dwarf with a face covered in freckles called Anbera Fahack who is a tailor." href="#36214210-5179-43d3-91d0-5a73b407e1b9">Anbera Fahack</a> an up and coming tailor. During that time I realized being in that trade just wasn't for me. At one point, I went to find a sheep that had gone missing, and must have gotten lost- I ended up in a strange land, where the colours were not as they should have been. I eventually found my way back, but never found the missing sheep. It turned up, completely skeletised in my bed three days later.</div></details>  <div class="classTable">   <details open=""><summary>Relationships</summary>   <table>       <tr>       <th>Name</th>

Oh, and I can't forget the time I won honorable mention at a garden tournament for my enormous pointsettias. One time there was a civil war within the town that I fought in. I suffered only minor injuries, and the wounds all healed without leaving any scars.
