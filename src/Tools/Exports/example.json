A procession of ghosts is currently taking place.</p> <article><h3>Government in Oliviavante</h3>The people of Oliviavante work the land in a loosely organised sense; there is no concept of ownership, and the majority of the town's citizens are hunter-gatherers.

The trade guild enforces rules, with stiff penalties and trade bans for rule-breakers. Welfare is bad. Citizens can expect the bare minimum of death services. Healthcare and education are fringe cases, and citizens would do better to seek a private benefactor than try and receive treatment from the government.</article> <article><h4>Law and Order</h4>The policing presence in Oliviavante is a militia; most of the guards of <a class=\"link-internal afd9ff6f-ae72-4866-adcc-0b21440576ee\" aria-expanded=\"false\" title=\"A slightly above average sized guards watch called The Peacemen of Club\">The Peacemen of Club</a> are part time, and there is little need for the use of force. Citizens act with honesty, and have no need for 24/7 guards. Law in Oliviavante is punitive based, and those that breach the laws can expect hard labor, incarceration, fines, or, in some instances, public execution. Crime is an ugly stain on humanity, to be removed wherever possible. Magic is not codified into the laws as anything specific, though the local guards would be more likely to treat it as a threat rather than not.</article> <details id=\"TownListRaces\" open=\"\"><summary>Racial Demographics</summary> <div class=\"classTable\" id=\"races\"><span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">Oliviavante is comprised <span class=\"tippy-races-percentage\"></span></span>.  <table>     <tr>         <th>Race</th>         <th>Population</th>         <th>Percentage</th>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Dragonborn</td>         <td>43</td>         <td>0.74</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Dwarf</td>         <td>81</td>         <td>1.41</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Elf</td>         <td>708</td>         <td>12.22</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Gnome</td>         <td>515</td>         <td>8.89</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Goblin</td>         <td>78</td>         <td>1.35</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Half-elf</td>         <td>292</td>         <td>5.04</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Half-orc</td>         <td>69</td>         <td>1.20</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Halfling</td>         <td>2177</td>         <td>37.54</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Human</td>         <td>1559</td>         <td>26.89</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Lizardfolk</td>         <td>62</td>         <td>1.07</td>     </tr>      <tr>         <td>Tiefling</td>         <td>211</td>         <td>3.65</td>     </tr>  </table> </div></details> <details id=\"TownListReligion\" open=\"\"><summary>Religious Demographics</summary><br><div class=\"classTable\" id=\"religion\"><span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">Oliviavante mostly worships Ariadne</span>.<br><table>    <tr>        <th>Deity</th>        <th>Population</th>        <th>Percentage</th>    </tr>    <tr>        <td><a class=\"link-internal hebe\" aria-expanded=\"false\" title=\"Hebe, Goddess of Eternal Youth, who is a lesser deity in the pantheon.\">Hebe</a></td>        <td>452</td>        <td>7.80</td>    </tr>        <tr>        <td><a class=\"link-internal chiron\" aria-expanded=\"false\" title=\"Chiron, Wisest of the Centaurs, who is an immortal in the pantheon.\">Chiron</a></td>        <td>195</td>        <td>3.36</td>    </tr>        <tr>        <td><a class=\"link-internal apollo\" aria-expanded=\"false\" title=\"The twin brother of Artemis, Apollo is the inventor of music.
