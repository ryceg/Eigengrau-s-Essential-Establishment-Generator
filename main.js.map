shortcuts [e.g. x.fm(), x.d()]\r\n  perform slightly worse / are slightly slower than the other potential syntax modes.\r\n  Supported syntax:\r\n    1. the dice roller: (all the following work and

The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.,,When you create a device, choose one of the following options:,,Clockwork Toy. This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.,,Fire Starter. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.,,Music Box. When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  'goblin': {\r\n    probability: 1,\r\n    muscleMass: 9,\r\n    bmiModifier: 703,\r\n    ageTraits:

plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring—this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.\r\n\r\n      The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).`,\r\n      followers: {\r\n        description: '',\r\n        favouredWeapon: '',\r\n        holyDays: {\r\n          earth: []\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      gods: [\r\n        { // Odin\r\n          objectType: 'deity',\r\n          passageName: 'DeityProfile',\r\n          name: 'Odin',\r\n          key: 'Odin',\r\n          status: 'alive',\r\n          titles: [\r\n            'The Allfather',\r\n            'Lord of the Aesir',\r\n            'Flaming Eye',\r\n            'Battle Enhancer',\r\n            'Ancient One',\r\n            'Enemy of the Wolf',\r\n            'God of Burdens',\r\n            'Wise One',\r\n            'Spear god',\r\n            'Swift in Deciet',\r\n            'Wand Bearer',\r\n            'Teacher of Gods',\r\n            'Vistor of the Hanged',\r\n            'Father of Hosts',\r\n            'Raven God',\r\n            'The Hanging One',\r\n            'God of Victory'\r\n          ],\r\n          rank: 'leader',\r\n          description: undefined,\r\n          appearance: '',\r\n          history: undefined,\r\n          powers: undefined,\r\n          portfolios: [\r\n            'wisdom',\r\n            'death',\r\n            'royalty',\r\n            'the gallows',\r\n            'war',\r\n            'battle',\r\n            'victory',\r\n            'sorcery',\r\n            'poetry',\r\n            'frenzy',\r\n            'runic alphabet'\r\n          ],\r\n          gender: 'man',\r\n          shape: 'human',\r\n          race: 'god',\r\n          faction: 'aesir',\r\n          domains: [\r\n            'knowledge',\r\n            'trickery',\r\n            'war',\r\n            'arcana'\r\n          ],\r\n          channelDivinity: [],\r\n          alignment: 'Lawful Good',\r\n          symbol: '',\r\n          combat: {\r\n            description: undefined,\r\n            weapon: 'spear',\r\n            weaponDescription: undefined,\r\n            tactics: undefined\r\n          },\r\n          possessions: [\r\n            {\r\n              title: 'Gungir',\r\n              description: 'The spear Gungir is so well balanced it can hit any target, regardless of skill'\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              title: 'Draupnir',\r\n              description: 'A gold ring which drips forth eight identical rings after nine days'\r\n            }\r\n          ],\r\n          realm: 'Valhalla',\r\n          followers: {\r\n            description: undefined,\r\n            favouredWeapon: '',\r\n            holyDays: {\r\n              earth: [\r\n                { title: 'Wednesday' }\r\n              ]\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          personality: {\r\n            just: 70,\r\n            merciful: -85,\r\n            chaste: -20\r\n          },\r\n          associations: {\r\n            avatars: [\r\n              {\r\n                name: undefined,\r\n                appearance: undefined,\r\n                description: undefined,\r\n                frequency: undefined,\r\n                powers: undefined\r\n              }\r\n            ],\r\n            animals: [\r\n              'raven',\r\n              'wolf'\r\n            ],\r\n            plants: [\r\n              'poppy'\r\n            ],\r\n            monsters: [],\r\n            gems: [],\r\n            colours: [],\r\n            miscellaneous: []\r\n          },\r\n          beliefs: undefined,\r\n          heresies: undefined,\r\n          blessings: undefined,\r\n          curses: undefined,\r\n          allies: [],\r\n          enemies: [],\r\n          relationships: []\r\n        },\r\n        { // Thor\r\n          objectType: 'deity',\r\n          passageName: 'DeityProfile',\r\n          name: 'Thor',\r\n          key: 'Thor',\r\n          status: 'alive',\r\n          titles: [\r\n            'The one who Rides Alone',\r\n            'The one who Rules Alone',\r\n            'Protector of the Shrine',\r\n            'The Loud Weather God',\r\n            'The terrible',\r\n            'The Thunderer',\r\n            'Odinson',\r\n            'Strong-Spirit'\r\n          ],\r\n          rank: 'greater deity',\r\n          description: 'Thor is the God of Lightning, Thunder and Storms.
