The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.,,After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.\",\n      'Damage Resistance': 'You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.'\n    }\n  },\n  'dwarf': {\n    muscleMass: 11,\n    bmiModifier: 500,\n    ageTraits: {\n      'ageDescriptors': [\n        [300, 'ancient'],\n        [250, 'incredibly elderly'],\n        [200, 'vulnerably elderly'],\n        [190, 'withered'],\n        [180, 'elderly'],\n        [170, 'weathered'],\n        [160, 'aged'],\n        [150, 'old'],\n        [140, 'middle aged'],\n        [80, 'middle aged'],\n        [50, 'early middle aged'],\n        [40, 'adult'],\n        [35, 'mid thirties'],\n        [32, 'earlyish thirties'],\n        [30, 'prime adult aged'],\n        [26, 'young adult'],\n        [24, 'youthful adult'],\n        [22, 'relatively young'],\n        [20, 'surprisingly young'],\n        [19, 'nineteen year old'],\n        [18, 'barely adult aged'],\n        [17, 'late teenager'],\n        [16, 'teenager'],\n        [15, 'young teenager'],\n        [14, 'adolescent'],\n        [12, 'prepubescent'],\n        [10, 'child'],\n        [8, 'young child'],\n        [6, 'toddler'],\n        [0, 'newborn']\n      ],\n      'elderly': {\n        baseAge: 197,\n        ageModifier: () => dice(3, 50)\n      },\n      'settled adult': {\n        baseAge: 50,\n        ageModifier: () => dice(3, 50)\n      },\n      'young adult': {\n        baseAge: 15,\n        ageModifier: () => dice(4, 8)\n      },\n      'child': {\n        baseAge: 4,\n        ageModifier: () => dice(3, 6)\n      }\n    },\n    genderTraits: {\n      woman: {\n        firstName: ['Anbera', 'Artin', 'Audhild', 'Balifra', 'Barbena', 'Bardryn', 'Bolhild', 'Dagnal', 'Dafifi', 'Delre', 'Diesa', 'Hdeth', 'Eridred', 'Falkrann', 'Fallthra', 'Finelien', 'Gillydd', 'Gunnloa', 'Gurdis', 'Helgret', 'Helja', 'Hihna', 'Illde', 'Jarana', 'Kathra', 'Kilia', 'Kristryd', 'Liftrasa', 'Marastyr', 'Mardred', 'Morana', 'Nalaed', 'Nora', 'Nurkara', 'Orifi', 'Ovina', 'Riswynn', 'Sannl', 'Therlin', 'Thodris', 'Torbera', 'Tordrid', 'Torgga', 'Urshar', 'Valida', 'Vistra', 'Vonana', 'Werydd', 'Whurdred', 'Yurgunn'],\n        beardProbability: 20,\n        baseHeight: 43,\n        baseWeight: 120,\n        heightModifier: () => dice(2, 4),\n        weightModifier: () => dice(2, 6)\n      },\n      man: {\n        firstName: ['Adrik', 'Alberich', 'Baern', 'Barendd', 'Beloril', 'Brottor', 'Dain', 'Dalgal', 'Darrak', 'Delg', 'Duergath', 'Dworic', 'Eberk', 'Einkil', 'Elaim', 'Erias', 'Fallond', 'Fargrim', 'Gardain', 'Garur', 'Gimgen', 'Gimurt', 'Harbek', 'Kildrak', 'Kilvar', 'Morgran', 'Morkral', 'Nalral', 'Nordak', 'Nuraval', 'Oloric', 'Olunt', 'Orsik', 'Oskar', 'Rangfim', 'Reirak', 'Rurik', 'Taklinn', 'Thoradin', 'Thorin', 'Thradal', 'Tordek', 'Traubon', 'Travok', 'Ulfgar', 'Urain', 'Veit', 'Vonbin', 'Vondal', 'Whurbin'],\n        beardProbability: 96,\n        baseHeight: 45,\n        baseWeight: 150,\n        heightModifier: () => dice(2, 4),\n        weightModifier: () => dice(2, 6)\n      },\n      entity: {},\n      nonbinary: {\n        firstName: ['Adzin', 'Dorn', 'Dorft']\n      }\n    },\n    lastName: ['Aranore', 'Balderk', 'Battlehammer', 'Bigtoe', 'Bloodkith', 'Bofdarm', 'Brawnanvil', 'Brazzik', 'Broodfist', 'Burrowfound', 'Caebrek', 'Daerdahk', 'Dankil', 'Daraln', 'Deepdelver', 'Durthane', 'Eversharp', 'FaHack', 'Fire-forge', 'Foamtankard', 'Frostbeard', 'Glanhig', 'Goblinbane', 'Goldfinder', 'Gorunn', 'Graybeard', 'Hammerstone', 'Helcral', 'Holderhek', 'Ironfist', 'Loderr', 'Lutgehr', 'Morigak', 'Orcfoe', 'Rakankrak', 'RubyEye', 'Rumnaheim', 'Silveraxe', 'Silverstone', 'Steelfist', 'Stoutale', 'Strakeln', 'Strongheart', 'Thrahak', 'Torevir', 'Torunn', 'Trollbleeder', 'Trueanvil', 'Trueblood', 'Ungart'],\n    eyes: ['yellow', 'amber', 'brown', 'dark brown', 'hazel', 'green', 'blue', 'gray', 'brown', 'dark brown', 'hazel', 'green', 'blue', 'gray', 'aqua'],\n    raceWords: {\n      raceName: 'dwarf',\n      racePlural: 'dwarves',\n      raceSingular: 'dwarf',\n      raceAdjective: 'dwarven',\n      raceLanguage: 'Dwarven'\n    },\n    knownLanguages: ['Common', 'Dwarvish'],\n    beard: ['scraggly beard', 'long, flowing beard', 'well-groomed beard going down to his chest', 'goatee', 'goatee that seems to be trying to level up into a beard', 'well-loved beard, with ornamental beads woven into it', 'long, luxurious beard', 'long, well-kempt beard', 'rather wild, unkempt beard', 'dreadful beard'],\n    abilities: {\n      'Darkvision': \"Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring—this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.\n\n      The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).`,\n      followers: {\n        description: '',\n        favouredWeapon: '',\n        holyDays: {\n          title: 'Holy Days',\n          children: []\n        }\n      },\n      gods: [\n        { // Odin\n          objectType: 'deity',\n          passageName: 'DeityProfile',\n          name: 'Odin',\n          key: 'Odin',\n          status: 'alive',\n          titles: [\n            'The Allfather',\n            'Lord of the Aesir',\n            'Flaming Eye',\n            'Battle Enhancer',\n            'Ancient One',\n            'Enemy of the Wolf',\n            'God of Burdens',\n            'Wise One',\n            'Spear god',\n            'Swift in Deciet',\n            'Wand Bearer',\n            'Teacher of Gods',\n            'Vistor of the Hanged',\n            'Father of Hosts',\n            'Raven God',\n            'The Hanging One',\n            'God of Victory'\n          ],\n          aliases: [],\n          rank: 'leader',\n          description: '',\n          appearance: '',\n          history: {\n            title: 'history',\n            children: []\n          },\n          powers: {\n            title: 'powers',\n            children: []\n          },\n          portfolios: [\n            'wisdom',\n            'death',\n            'royalty',\n            'the gallows',\n            'war',\n            'battle',\n            'victory',\n            'sorcery',\n            'poetry',\n            'frenzy',\n            'runic alphabet'\n          ],\n          gender: 'man',\n          shape: 'human',\n          race: 'god',\n          faction: 'aesir',\n          domains: [\n            'knowledge',\n            'trickery',\n            'war',\n            'arcana'\n          ],\n          channelDivinity: {\n            title: 'Channel Divinity',\n            children: []\n          },\n          alignment: 'Lawful Good',\n          symbol: '',\n          combat: {\n            title: 'combat',\n            children: []\n          },\n          possessions: {\n            children: [\n              {\n                title: 'Gungir',\n                description: 'The spear Gungir is so well balanced it can hit any target, regardless of skill'\n              },\n              {\n                title: 'Draupnir',\n                description: 'A gold ring which drips forth eight identical rings after nine days'\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          realm: 'Valhalla',\n          followers: {\n            description: undefined,\n            favouredWeapon: '',\n            holyDays: {\n              title: 'Holy Days',\n              children: [\n                {\n                  title: 'earth',\n                  children: ['Wednesday']\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          personality: {\n            just: 70,\n            merciful: -85,\n            chaste: -20\n          },\n          associations: {\n            avatars: [],\n            animals: [\n              'raven',\n              'wolf'\n            ],\n            plants: [\n              'poppy'\n            ],\n            monsters: [],\n            gems: [],\n            colours: [],\n            miscellaneous: []\n          },\n          beliefs: {\n            title: 'beliefs',\n            children: []\n          },\n          heresies: {\n            title: 'heresies',\n            children: []\n          },\n          blessings: {\n            title: 'blessings',\n            children: []\n          },\n          curses: {\n            title: 'curses',\n            children: []\n          },\n          allies: {\n            title: 'allies',\n            children: []\n          },\n          enemies: {\n            title: 'enemies',\n            children: []\n          },\n          relationships: [\n\n          ],\n          maxims: [\n            {\n              title: ''\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        { // Thor\n          objectType: 'deity',\n          passageName: 'DeityProfile',\n          name: 'Thor',\n          key: 'Thor',\n          status: 'alive',\n          titles: [\n            'The one who Rides Alone',\n            'The one who Rules Alone',\n            'Protector of the Shrine',\n            'The Loud Weather God',\n            'The terrible',\n            'The Thunderer',\n            'Odinson',\n            'Strong-Spirit'\n          ],\n          aliases: [],\n          rank: 'greater deity',\n          description: 'Thor is the God of Lightning, Thunder and Storms.
